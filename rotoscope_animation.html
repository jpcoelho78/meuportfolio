  <h4 class="w">Rotoscope Animation</h4>
    <p class="p">
   The objective of this proposal is to develop an animation using the rotoscope technique in which an animation should be developed using the randomly selected classmate as a model.
The objective of this work is to develop an animation in order to produce a set of 3 Animated Stickers in GIF format. in which we are based on a video in which we had to intervene “frame by frame”, keeping or not the “live footage” that served as the basis for the construction of the gif. For the creation of this Gif I was inspired by other gifs already existing and widely used to create three identical gifs that could be used during any message exchange.
These three gifs were made in the ProCreate application with thirty to fifteen frame </p>
