    <h4 class="w">Project Motiro</h4>
    <p class="p">
     This project was made to celebrate the celebration as a witness. And the proposal was made to create a visual support for a celebration of a city in Portugal.
The celebration I chose were the Caretos de Prodence, which originate from the village of Prodence, in the municipality of Maçedo de Cavaleiros, which were declared a cultural heritage of Intangible Humanity by UNESCO.
The reason for choosing this celebration was the traditionality that goes behind the mountains whenever it takes place.
The poster was inspired by the typical costumes of the Caretos, and their movements as they rattle and jump through the streets.
